User Guide
****************************************

Before you can start using pSConfig Web Admin (PWA), you have to create at least one user account. Note that public registration is disabled by default. Read `User Management <pwa_user_management>`_ for details on this.

If you added a user via the CLI, you should be able to login. If you registered an account through the web interface, you may be prompted to confirm the ownership of the email address by following the confirmation URL in an email sent by the authentication service (or not, depending on your configuration).

You may edit existing entities with your name listed under "Admins" list for each entity. Certain features, such as to override the MA endpoints, requires you to have super-admin privileges. Please see :doc:`pwa_user_management` for more details.
